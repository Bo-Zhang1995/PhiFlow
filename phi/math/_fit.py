    Fits a line of the form *slope Â· x + offset* to pass through the data points defined by their coordinates `x` and `y`.

        x: X coordinate of the points.
        y: Y coordinate of the points.
        point_dim: Dimension listing the points the line should pass through. This dimension will be reduced in the operation.
